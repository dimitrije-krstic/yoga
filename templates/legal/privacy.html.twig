            <h3> &#8226; Streaming</h3>
<p>On some of our Website pages we embed <b>YouTube</b> videos posted by our Members.</p>

<p>YouTube LLC (901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA) is the operator of the corresponding plug-ins. When you visit a page with the YouTube plugin, a connection to Youtube servers is established. Youtube will be informed which pages you visit. If you are logged into your Youtube account, Youtube can assign your surfing behavior to you personally. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account beforehand.</p>

<p>If a YouTube video is started, the provider uses cookies that collect information about user behavior. If you have deactivated the storage of cookies for the Google Ad program, you will not have to deal with such cookies when viewing YouTube videos.

If you do not click on the graphic, there is no exchange between You and the providers of the social media buttons. Information about the collection and use of your data in the social networks can be found in their respective terms of use: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</a>.</p>


<h3> &#8226; Use of script libraries (Google Web Fonts)</h3>
<p>In order to present our contents correctly and graphically appealing across all browsers, we use script libraries and font libraries such as <b>Google Web Fonts</b> on this website.</p>
            <p>Google Web Fonts (<a href="https://www.google.com/webfonts/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/webfonts/</a>) are transferred to your browser’s cache to avoid multiple loading. If your browser does not support Google Web Fonts or does not allow access, content will be displayed in a default font.
